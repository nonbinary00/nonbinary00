## 🔹 About Me

I’m an early-career Machine Learning Engineer based in Berlin, with a strong interest in understanding how neural networks learn and generalize — not just how to train them.

I’m particularly curious about:
- how models develop internal representations,
- how optimization dynamics influence convergence and stability,
- and how architectural choices affect performance and generalization.

I’m also interested in how AI systems move from experimentation to production environments — where reproducibility, reliability, and integration with existing systems become essential.

Beyond classical deep learning, I explore LLM-based workflows and prompt engineering, focusing on how large language models can be integrated into structured, real-world applications.

I enjoy building projects that are not only functional, but well-structured and reproducible — approaching machine learning as an engineering discipline rather than purely research.
